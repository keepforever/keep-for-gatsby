#### Long Story Short:
I perform my favorite popular songs across a wide range of genres and eras. **Visit the "Song List"** tab to browse songs that I enjoy singing.  

#### Geography:
I currently live in **San Francisco** and am willing to travel throughout the greater **Bay Area** for gigs.

#### Do I have a sound system?:
**Yes**, I have my own PA suitable for a small-medium size venues.
**However**, I would prefer to use a house sound system if available.

#### What's the cost?:
I enjoy playing **a lot**, so, compensation is negotiable. Let's chat.

**e.g.:** $50-$150 (depending on set length, travel time, and if I need to deploy my sound system), with the ability to put out a tip jar and ask for tips.
